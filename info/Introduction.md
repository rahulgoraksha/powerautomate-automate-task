# Idea behind Power Automate

## Power Automate
- it tends to mimics the human task which are click based
- inside the power automate consist of 3varient
    - orchestration model (worflow)
    - Connectors (actions)
    - infrastructure (script & result overview dashboard)

## What is course about?
- Master Power Automate: 
    - Automate any single worflow (simple, complex, multi-interaction) with no-code
    - leverage connectors to integrate automation into all your application
    - Understand Power Automate features like approval, AI, data operation and more
    - Build full end-to-end workflow automations from scratch (internal and external) based

## Course Roadmap? Supervsison based approach

- Environment Setup

## Features of Power Automate:
1. No-code/ easy to use and amaster
2. Connectors (its comprehensive -gmail, outlook integration)
3. Microsoft (fully-integrated)
4. Powerful orchestration (loops, condition, approval, etc)
5. Production-ready and enterprise-grade
6. Tracing and debugging
7. Generative AI ready - reading invoice
8. Extensible (awesome)

## keys to success
- do, don't watch
- explore
- Ask question / get involved

1. create worflows
2. Templates
3. My flows
4. Environments

## What is Power Automate Flow?
### What is a flow?
- It is a visual representation of any task (Trigger-Action)
- Trigger: activate the workflow
- Action: series of steps followed after Trigger

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
|Email    | Add row in excel|
|Click    | Slack Message|
|Time    | File Movement|

- flow can have a multiple actions: Trigger --> Action 1 --> Action 2 --> Action 3
- flow can have condition, loops and human-input

### Type of Flow?
![Types of flow](image-1.png)

- Automatd Cloud flow: Runs automatically when something happens (like receiving an email or a new file being added).
- Instant Cloud flow: Runs immediately when you manually click a button or trigger it yourself.
- Schedule Cloud flow: Runs automatically at a fixed time or interval (daily, weekly, monthly).
- Describe it to design it: You explain what you want in simple words, and Copilot helps create the flow for you.
- Deskstop flow: Automates tasks on your computer by mimicking human actions like clicks, typing, and copying.
- Process mining: Analyzes real system data to show how a business process actually runs and where it can be improved.

- Business Process flow: An application that guides users through predefined business stages and steps, ensuring processes are followed in the correct order with consistent data capture.
- Deskstop flow: An application that automates manual, repetitive desktop tasks by simulating human actions across applications where APIs or integrations are not available.
